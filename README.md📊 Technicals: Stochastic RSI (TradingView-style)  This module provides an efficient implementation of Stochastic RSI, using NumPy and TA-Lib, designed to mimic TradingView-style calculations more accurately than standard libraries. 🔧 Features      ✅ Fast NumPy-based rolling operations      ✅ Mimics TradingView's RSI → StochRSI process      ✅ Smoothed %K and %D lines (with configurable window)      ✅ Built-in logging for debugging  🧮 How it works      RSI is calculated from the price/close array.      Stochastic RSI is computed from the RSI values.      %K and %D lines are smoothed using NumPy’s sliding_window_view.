📊 Technicals: Stochastic RSI (TradingView-style)

This module provides an efficient implementation of Stochastic RSI, using NumPy and TA-Lib, designed to mimic TradingView-style calculations more accurately than standard libraries.
🔧 Features

    ✅ Fast NumPy-based rolling operations

    ✅ Mimics TradingView's RSI → StochRSI process

    ✅ Smoothed %K and %D lines (with configurable window)

    ✅ Built-in logging for debugging

🧮 How it works

    RSI is calculated from the price/close array.

    Stochastic RSI is computed from the RSI values.

    %K and %D lines are smoothed using NumPy’s sliding_window_view.

📦 Dependencies

Ensure you install:

pip install numpy TA-Lib

📈 Example

import numpy as np
from technicals import Technicals

# Example price array
prices = np.array([
    84108.71, 84169.82, 84138.83, 84147.58, 84143.41,
    84156.24, 84098.49, 84000.01, 83992.83, 83978.26,
    # ... more values ...
])

technicals = Technicals()
stoch_k, stoch_d = technicals.calculate_stoch_rsi_as_tradingview_numpy_fast(prices)
print("Stochastic RSI %K:", stoch_k)
print("Stochastic RSI %D:", stoch_d)

⚠️ Notes

Needs at least period + k + d data points to produce valid output.

Returns None if input is too short.

Logging will output debug messages to stdout.
